To do 
- Pull the data using the api 
- Store the data into a local file (for cache)
- Remove the users to exclude from the data 
- Get a subset of the data for chainlink users
    The analysis
     - Chainlink TVL vs Ethereum TVL, Arbitrum etc..
     - Chainlink TVL vs Total TVL
     - How to get Chainlink TVL?
        - Use 
- Get another subset of the data for all the users 
- Make the graphs in jupyter first

If there is time
- Make the graphs in streamlit or dash so we have a web application that can be hosted
- Work on tooltip hover over feature (would make comparisons much easier than just using eye)
- Use seaborn for nicer visualisations
- Clean up code (there is code reuse, some code could be more efficient), visualisations could be nicer
- Add a count/total dollar value into the piecharts 
- Better names for the titles and the x and y axis
- More dynamic graphs to be able to zoom in and select the protocols in smaller groups
- When I work with dataframes, I use ' for strings when I work with python I use "

Plotting in excel, PBI would be easier and faster but automating graphs in one report has it's advantages
